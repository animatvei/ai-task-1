/* 1. **Root Cause of the Slide-Down Glitch:**
The glitch occurs because the `.menu` is absolutely positioned and uses `transform: translateY(-150%)` to hide it. When toggled open, it uses `transform: translateY(0)`. However, since the menu is still present in the DOM and its height is not zero when hidden, it can cause layout jumps or "glitches" as the menu animates in and out, especially if the menu's content height changes or if the menu is not fully off-screen.

**Key issues:**
- The menu is only visually moved, not actually removed from the flow or hidden, so it may still be focusable or interactable.
- The transition may not be smooth if the menu's height is dynamic or if the transform doesn't fully move it out of view.

2. **Patched `styles.css`:**
```css */

.nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
.menu {
  display: flex;
  gap: 2rem;
}
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .menu {
    flex-direction: column;
    position: absolute;
    top: 64px;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    background: #fff;
    transform: translateY(-150%);
    opacity: 0;
    pointer-events: none;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease, opacity 0.3s ease;
    z-index: 1000;
  }
  .menu.open {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 1;
    pointer-events: auto;
  }
}

/* ```

**Explanation of the fix:**
- Added `opacity: 0` and `pointer-events: none` to `.menu` when closed, so it's not visible or interactable.
- When `.menu.open` is active, set `opacity: 1` and `pointer-events: auto` for smooth fade-in and interaction.
- This ensures the menu is fully hidden and non-interactive when closed, preventing glitches and improving accessibility. */
